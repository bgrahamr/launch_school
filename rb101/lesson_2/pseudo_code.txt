1. A method that returns the sum of two integers

Plain English:
Given two integers 
Add to the two numbers together
Return the result

Pseudo-code:
SET num1 = some integer
SET num2 = some integer

SET result = sum of num1 and num2
PRINT result
END


2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

Plain English:
Given an array of strings

Set a result variable to an empty string
Iterate though the strings of the array
  - Concatenate each string to the result variable

After iterating through the array, return the concatenated result

Pseudo Code:
Given an array of strings

SET result = an empty string
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator <= length of array
  Concatenate each current value to result
  iterator += 1
  
PRINT result
END


3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

Plain English:
Given an array of integers

Initialize a result variable as an empty array
Iterate through the arroay of integers
  - For each iteration, determine whether the index is even
  - If even, append the integer to result
  - Otherwise, go to next iteration

After iterating through array of integers, return the result array

Pseudo Code:
Given an array of integers

SET result = an empty array
SET iterator = 1

WHILE iterator <= length of array
  iterator += 1
  IF index is even
    append integer to result
  ELSE
    go to next interation
    
PRINT result
END
